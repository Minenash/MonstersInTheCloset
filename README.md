# Monsters in the Closet

This is a pretty simple **fabric** mod that highlights the mobs that prevent you from sleeping. To avoid it being exploitative, it'll only highlight the mobs if the message you get would be "Can't sleep now; monsters near by", and it only highlights for 3 seconds.

<br>

If installed on the **client**, it'll work in **singleplayer** and **any server**. If it's installed on the server, than everyone can see the highlights, even those without the mod.
